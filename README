Build simplefs inside vm.
Based on xfstests-bld (git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/ext2/xfstests-bld.git).

I do this for several reasons:
- testing (without panic on desktop)
- new developer, could just use this scripts, to see how it works
- various tests using new kernels

How it works:
- cd appliance/; sudo ./gen-image; cd -
- sudo ./kvm-sfs /src/oss/linux-vms/arch/x86/boot/bzImage /path/to/simplefs

And you are done!
